⦁	Day of Week
Enter a day number [1…7] and print the name (in English) or "Invalid day!"

⦁	Rounding Numbers
Read an array of real numbers (space separated), round them in "away from 0" style and print the output as in the examples:

⦁	Even and Odd Subtraction
Write a program that calculates the difference between the sum of the even and the sum of the odd numbers in an array.

⦁	Equal Arrays
Read two arrays and print on the console whether they are identical or not. Arrays are identical if their elements are equal.
If the arrays are identical find the sum of the first one and print on the console following message:
"Arrays are identical. Sum: {sum}", otherwise find the first index where the arrays differ and print on the console following message:
"Arrays are not identical. Found difference at {index} index".

⦁	Condense Array to Number
Write a program to read an array of integers and condense them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single integer is obtained.
For example, if we have 3 elements {2, 10, 3}, we sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13},
then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.
