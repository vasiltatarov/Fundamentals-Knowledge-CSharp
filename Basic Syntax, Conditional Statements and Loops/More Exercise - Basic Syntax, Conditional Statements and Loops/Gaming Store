Write a program, which helps you buy the games. The valid games are the following games in this table:
On the first line, you will receive your current balance – a floating-point number in the range [0.00…5000.00].
Until you receive the command "Game Time", you have to keep buying games.
When a game is bought, the user’s balance decreases by the price of the game.
Additionally, the program should obey the following conditions:
If a game the user is trying to buy is not present in the table above, print "Not Found" and read the next line.
If at any point, the user has $0 left, print "Out of money! " and end the program.
Alternatively, if the user is trying to buy a game which they can’t afford, print "Too Expensive" and read the next line"
If the game exists and the player has the money for it, print "Bought {nameOfGame}"
When you receive "Game Time", print the user’s remaining money and total spent on games, rounded to the 2nd decimal place.
