Write a program, which keeps a dictionary with synonyms.The key of the dictionary will be the word.
The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word. You will be given a number n – the count of the words.
After each word, you will be given a synonym, so the count of lines you have to read from the console is 2 * n.
You will be receiving a word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:
⦁	{word}
⦁	{synonym}
If you get the same word twice, just add the new synonym to the list. 

            int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            Dictionary<string, List<string>> wordSynonyms = new Dictionary<string, List<string>>();

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                string word = Console.ReadLine();
                string synonym = Console.ReadLine();

                if (wordSynonyms.ContainsKey(word))
                {
                    wordSynonyms[word].Add(synonym);
                }
                else
                {
                    wordSynonyms.Add(word, new List<string>());
                    wordSynonyms[word].Add(synonym);
                }
            }

            foreach (var word in wordSynonyms)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{word.Key} - {string.Join(", ", word.Value)}");
            }
