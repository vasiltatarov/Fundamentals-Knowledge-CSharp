When you receive a player and his position and skill, add him to the player pool, if he isn`t present, else add his position and skill
or update his skill, only if the current position skill is lower than the new value.
If you receive "{player} vs {player}" and both players exist in the tier, they duel with the following rules:
Compare their positions, if they got at least one in common, the player with better total skill points wins and the other is
demoted from the tier -> remove him. If they have same total skill points, the duel is tie and they both continue in the Season.
If they don`t have positions in common, the duel isn`t happening and both continue in the Season.
