You know the judge system, right?! Your job is to create a program similar to the Judge system. 
You will receive several input lines in one of the following formats: {username} -> {contest} -> {points}

The constestName and username are strings, the given points will be an integer number. You need to keep track of every contest
and individual statistics of every user. You should check if such contest already exists, and if not, add it, otherwise check if
the current user Is participating in the contest, if he is participating take the higher score, otherwise just add it.

Also you need to keep individual statistics for each user - the total points of all constests. 
You should end your program when you receive the command "no more time". At that point you should print each contest in order of input,
for each contest print the participants ordered by points in desecending order, than ordered by name in ascending order.After that, you
should print individual statistics for every participant ordered by total points in desecnding order, and then byalphabetical order.
Input / Constraints
The input comes in the form of commands in one of the formats specified above.
Username and contest name always will be one word.
Points will be an integer will be an integer in range [0, 1000].
There will be no invalid input lines.
If all sorting criteria fail, the order should be by order of input.
The input ends when you receive the command "no more time".
Output
The output format for the contests is:
{constestName}: {participants.Count} participants
{position}. {username} <::> {points}
After you print all contests, print the individual statistics for every participant.
The output format is:
Individual standings:
{position}. {username} -> {totalPoints}
if username and contest exist (if new points > current points) replace points or username exest and contest doesnt exist addnew points..

Pesho -> Algo -> 400
Gosho -> Algo -> 300
Stamat -> Algo -> 200
Pesho -> DS -> 150
Mimi -> DS -> 600
no more time

Algo: 3 participants
1. Pesho <::> 400
2. Gosho <::> 300
3. Stamat <::> 200
DS: 2 participants
1. Mimi <::> 600
2. Pesho <::> 150
Individual standings:
1. Mimi -> 600
2. Pesho -> 550
3. Gosho -> 300
4. Stamat -> 200
