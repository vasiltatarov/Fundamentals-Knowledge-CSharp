Spice is Love, Spice is Life. And most importantly, Spice must flow. It must be extracted from the scorching sands of Arrakis, under 
constant threat of giant sand worms. To make the work as efficient as possible, the Duke has tasked you with the creation of a
management software. Write a program that calculates the total amount of spice that can be extracted from a source.
The source has a starting yield, which indicates how much spice can be mined on the first day. After it has been mined for a day,
the yield drops by 10, meaning on the second day it’ll produce 10 less spice than on the first, on the third day 10 less than on
the second, and so on (see examples). A source is considered profitable only while its yield is at least 100 – when less than
100 spice is expected in a day, abandon the source. 
The mining crew consumes 26 spice every day at the end of their shift and an additional 26 after the mine has been exhausted.
Note that the workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage. 
When the operation is complete, print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and
the total amount of spice extracted. 
Input 
You will receive a number, representing the starting yield of the source. 
111
Output 
Print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and the total amount of spice extracted.

                startingYield -= 10;
