Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator of capacity of p persons.
The input holds two lines: the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator.

            int numberOfPeople = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            int capacity = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            double courses = (double)numberOfPeople / capacity;
            Console.WriteLine(Math.Ceiling(courses));
