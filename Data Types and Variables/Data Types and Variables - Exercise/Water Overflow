You have a water tank with capacity of 255 liters. On the next n lines, you will receive liters of water,
which you have to pour in your tank. If the capacity is not enough, print “Insufficient capacity!” and continue reading the next line.
On the last line, print the liters in the tank.

Every time you do not have enough capacity in the tank to pour the given liters, print:
Insufficient capacity!
On the last line, print only the liters in the tank.

            int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            int tankCapacity = 0;

            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            {
                int quantityWaterYouHaveToPour = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

                if ((quantityWaterYouHaveToPour + tankCapacity) <= 255)
                {
                    tankCapacity += quantityWaterYouHaveToPour;
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Insufficient capacity!");
                }
            }

            Console.WriteLine(tankCapacity);
