Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic.
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than some fixed constant eps. 
You will receive two lines, each containing a floating-point number. Your task is to compare the values of the two numbers.

            double firstNumber = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
            double secondNumber = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            bool isEqual = Math.Max((decimal)firstNumber, (decimal)secondNumber) - Math.Min((decimal)firstNumber, (decimal)secondNumber) < (decimal)0.000001;
            if (isEqual)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(isEqual);
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine(isEqual);
            }
